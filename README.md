Howconf - aka "Hands On Workshop"
=================================

Planning for a 2013 howconference in Omaha, Nebraska.

There's lots of discussion going on in the github Issues list (click above). 

And join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omaha-unconf).

(This repo is called 'unconf' because when it was created the name/format 
of the conference hadn't yet been decided on.)
