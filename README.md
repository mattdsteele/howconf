Planning for a 2013 "Hands On Workshop" un/conference in Omaha, Nebraska.

The basic format will be hands on workshops lasting around 3 hours. You should be 
able to attend ~ 3 sessions in a given day.

We probably will market this towards teaching technical folks something new - the 
content wouldn't have to be technical, though. We could also do something for 
non-techies; it just wouldn't be the main focus of the event.

There's lots of discussion in progress in github [Issues](https://github.com/mattdsteele/unconf/issues).

Join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omaha-unconf).

(This repo name is 'unconf' because the name/format 
of the un/conference hadn't yet been decided.)
