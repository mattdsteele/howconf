LP: Literate Programming with Org-mode
======================================

Code documentation is something that is hard for many programmers, especially on large projects.
That's where LP comes in: Literate Programming is a way to write your code, and document it easily.
Although there are things like NoWeb, WEB, and CWEB, Org-mode is simple, and and provides many things
other than a literate programming tool.
