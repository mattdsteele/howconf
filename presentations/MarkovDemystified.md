Markov Demystified
==================

We've all heard the term "Markov Chain" or "Markov Decision Process" used when talking about
something that exhibits pretty stunning behavior. One would even say "intelligent" behavior.
This talk aims to start off discussing precisely what a "Markov <insert term>" really means,
terminology for probability, and some hand waving at math symbols followed by a hands-on
session where we use it to predict the weather for the rest of the conference.

Presenter Info
==============

Nick Wertzberger is currently working on a CS Master's Degree with a focus in Artificial
Intelligence. Markov Decision Processes have become an interest of his after doing an
assignment where a program that could only tell that it "bumped" something used a map
to reason what location it must be in, and with what confidence it knew that information.
It wasn't just sure, it was *92.38%* sure.

Since this time, he has written a blog post on the subject
(http://www.ideaheap.com/2012/11/using-the-power-of-the-markov-property/)
and has started work on an open source library that implements some of these ideas into
a cohesive framework.

Description
===========

Expected Participant Experience Level:
* A JVM language (the language used to present will likely be Java/Groovy), or a calculator and paper.
* An understanding that all possible probabilities need to add up to 1.

Topics Covered:
* Probability
* Markov Assumptions
* Markov Chains
* Markov Decision Processes

Discussion topic (at the end):
* When should you apply this?
